## What i have learnt By working on this project
1. Got an ideo of modern web designs 
2. Have learnt how to reuse code in css

I had took about 3hr 23min approximately as i was not tracking the time this project was a bit tougher for me from the other ones as it forced me to know how to select siblings without class, attribute or id selector
